## About

The protein sliding window app allows users to generate peptides of a desired length based on a given amino acid sequence. The sliding window method begins with a "window" of set length on the amino acid chain and returns the first generated peptide. From there, the sliding window moves down 1 amino acid and returns the next generated peptide until the end of the amino acid sequence is reached.
